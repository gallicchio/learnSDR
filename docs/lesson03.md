# Lesson 3 --- Complex Numbers in Software-Defined Radio

Although a radio signal is inherently a real thing---the electric field has a real magnitude and direction at a given point in space and time---the frequency shifting inherent in radio inherently introduces complex numbers, as we will see. So, to prepare, let's review some basic properties of complex numbers.

In general, a complex number has a real part and an imaginary part: $$z = x + iy$$, where $$x$$ and $$y$$ are real numbers and $$i = \sqrt{-1}$$. To add two complex numbers, just add the real parts and add the imaginary parts. For example, to add $$2+1i$$ and $$1 + 3i$$, add the real parts ($$2+1=3$$) and add the imaginary parts ($$1i + 3i = 4i$$). The result is $$3 + 4i$$.

A very useful way to visualize this process is to represent complex numbers with their real part along the $$x$$ axis and their imaginary part along the $$y$$ axis. This same addition problem is illustrated in the following figure.
