# Lesson 3 --- Complex Numbers in Software-Defined Radio

Although a radio signal is inherently a real thing---the electric field has a real magnitude and direction at a given point in space and time---the frequency shifting inherent in radio inherently introduces complex numbers, as we will see. So, to prepare, let's review some basic properties of complex numbers.

In general, a complex number has a real part and an imaginary part: $$z = x + iy$$, where $$x$$ and $$y$$ are real numbers and $$i = \sqrt{-1}$$.
