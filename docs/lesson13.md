# Lesson 13 --- Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)

Last time, we used 1 to represent binary 1, and -1 to represent binary 0 (although some people reverse these roles) in BPSK.

Coding is the one's bit is at negative -1/sqrt(2) and two's bit is at positive 1/sqrt(2) or
(-1-1j, -1+1j, 1-1j, 1+1j)

ordering is gray coding
