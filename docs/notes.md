Frequency locked loops (FLL)

automate the slider that adjusts the offset

The received spectrum isn't centered around zero.
I want the spectrum that is centered around zero.

Do a band-edge filter on the spectrum

You can create an entire filter in the time domain.
Take incoming data stream, pass through filter, 
Smooth error signal, and then nudge the 

AGC = automatic gain control

FLL Band-edge

  the filter rolloff factor (alpha)
  prototype filter size sps * 2 + 1
  loop bandwidth: 2*math.pi / sps / 100

Need a shift that is 

How do you actually form a filter in the time domain to get that response.
There are some nice mathematical forms of the humps. 


Lesson 18 Symbol Timing Synchronization (clock recovery)

error signal is the data times the slope or sign(x) x-dot

For this to work, you need to have transitions.
