The markdown ".md" files in the [/docs/](https://github.com/Physics-50/Module-1/tree/master/docs) folder get converted into the pages shown on the website. If you're new to markdown, [here is a cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet). Latex can be to the documents by using double dollar signs to enclose the math "$$ .. $$". See also [a description of kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html), which is the flavor of markdown we are using

You can use a "\<details>" tag to create expandable tabs: 

<details>
<summary markdown='span'> Click to expand </summary>

Take a look a the raw markdown file for how to format the "</details>" tag. 
</details>

To adjust the size of an image, you can use `style="width: 400px;"`.

To center it,
<p class="center" markdown="1">
